Agave Review, a 7C literary and art journal, is announcing our fall issue theme: UNCANNY.

This October, we are looking for art and literature that makes your skin crawl. How does a piece unsettle its audience, with or without the bells and whistles of Hollywood gore? Agave Review is seeking pieces that explore the uncanny-a moment or object that seems familiar but on closer inspection is anything but. Submit here: https://www.agave-review.com/submit.html<https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.agave-review.com%2Fsubmit.html&data=04%7C01%7Cstudent_information%40listserv.pomona.edu%7Cd5fb3e76183c4511eda108d98f34277e%7C817f590439044ee8b3a5a65d4746ff70%7C0%7C0%7C637698276433184688%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=rJ5OTyM4LyNas6S%2F1IGHkOgn0JIED0tMd8ktqnLFRTo%3D&reserved=0>
